### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a quantitative developer working on propriety trading software in C++ and Python. In the last 6-7 years I have been a software engineer in various guises.

A lot of the repositories you'll find here are hobby projects I'm messing around with to broaden my skills, pursue interests, and continue to practice my software engineering.
