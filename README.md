### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Master's student, a research assistant, and a tutor in the computing faculty at the University of Melbourne. My interests include security & privacy (especially cryptography), distributed systems, programming language theory, and pure mathematics.

A lot of the repositories you'll find here are hobby projects I'm messing around with to broaden my skills and continue to practice my software engineering.
